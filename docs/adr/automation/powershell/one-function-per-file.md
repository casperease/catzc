# ADR: One function per file

## Rules: ADR-AUTO-ONEFUNC

### Rule ADR-AUTO-ONEFUNC:1

Each `.ps1` file contains exactly one exported function, and the file name matches the function name (`Get-Foo.ps1` must contain
`function Get-Foo`).

- [How this is enforced](#how-this-is-enforced)

### Rule ADR-AUTO-ONEFUNC:2

Each function file pairs one-to-one with a test file named `Verb-Noun.Tests.ps1` (`Get-Foo.ps1` → `tests/Get-Foo.Tests.ps1`).

- [Why one function per file](#why-one-function-per-file)

## Context

We need a convention for how functions map to files within a module. The two common approaches are:

1. **Multiple functions per file** — group related functions together, use AST parsing or manual export lists to determine what gets
   exported.
2. **One function per file** — each `.ps1` file contains exactly one function, the file name matches the function name (`Get-Foo.ps1` →
   `function Get-Foo`).

### Why one function per file

**File listing = module API.** Running `ls` on a module folder immediately shows every public function. No need to open files, read
manifests, or run `Get-Command -Module`. New contributors can understand a module's surface area in seconds.

**No AST parsing needed for exports.** When file name equals function name, the manifest generator can derive `FunctionsToExport` directly
from file names — a string operation, not a parse. AST parsing is slow (~25ms per file) and adds complexity. With one-function-per-file, the
bootstrap module just uses `$file.BaseName` and skips the parser entirely. This directly impacts import speed.

**Merge conflicts disappear.** When two people add functions to the same file, they conflict. When each function is its own file, parallel
work on different functions never touches the same file. Git blame is also trivially useful — each file has a single author history.

**Searchability.** Looking for `Get-Customer`? The file is `Get-Customer.ps1`. No grepping, no guessing which file it lives in. Every
editor's file-open dialog becomes a function search.

**Consistent granularity.** There is no judgment call about "which functions belong together" or when a file has grown too large and needs
splitting. The rule is mechanical: one function, one file, names match.

**Test file pairing.** Each function file pairs naturally with a test file: `Get-Foo.ps1` → `tests/Get-Foo.Tests.ps1`. No ambiguity about
which test file covers which function.

## Decision

Each `.ps1` file contains exactly one exported function. The file name matches the function name: `Get-Foo.ps1` must contain
`function Get-Foo`.

### How this is enforced

- **`Test-Automation.Tests.ps1`** — validates every `.ps1` file: file name must be `Verb-Noun` format, must contain exactly one function,
  and function name must match the file basename.
- **Test file naming** — the same test validates that every `.Tests.ps1` file also follows `Verb-Noun.Tests.ps1` format.
- **Bootstrap module** — `New-DynamicManifest` derives `FunctionsToExport` directly from `$file.BaseName`, so files that do not follow the
  convention will not export correctly.

## Consequences

- File name is the function name — `$file.BaseName` is the export list
- AST parsing is eliminated from the bootstrap module's hot path
- Module contents are visible from a directory listing alone
- Each function has its own git history and blame
- Test files map 1:1 to function files
- Modules with many small functions will have many small files — this is acceptable and preferred over fewer large files
