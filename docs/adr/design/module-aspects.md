# ADR: Module aspects — a unit's files partition into live and tests

## Rules: ADR-ASPECT

### Rule ADR-ASPECT:1

Every module (and, at track granularity, every delivery package) **partitions** its tracked files into named **aspects** that are pairwise
**disjoint** and jointly **exhaustive** — a true partition, no file in two aspects and no file in none. The aspect set is the `aspects`
repo-wide variant (`Catzc.Base.Variants`, `ADR-VARIANT`): an ordered first-match ("fallthrough") classification, defaulting to `live` then
`tests` — the prod-going artifacts (`live`, what ships) and the means to verify them (`tests`).

### Rule ADR-ASPECT:2

Aspects are **auto-derived** from folder conventions, never hand-declared. `live` is a **closed** convention (folder-scoped patterns —
`*.ps1`, `private/**`, `types/**`, `configs/**` — that never reach `tests/`); the **last** aspect is the `**` catch-all remainder. Ordered
first-match makes the partition disjoint and exhaustive _by construction_: `AspectPartition.Compile` gives aspect _k_ the leaf scan program
`+ (its own patterns) − (every earlier aspect's patterns)`, all prefixed by the unit root (`ADR-GLOBS:4`).

### Rule ADR-ASPECT:3

The catch-all remainder is **non-live** (`tests` is declared last). `live` — the shipped surface — is never the fallthrough, so a stray or
unclassified file lands on the verification side and can **never silently ship** (default-deny). `Assert-VariantsConfig` and the aspect type
enforce this: the last aspect is the `**` catch-all, that aspect is not `live`, and `live` uses only closed patterns.

### Rule ADR-ASPECT:4

Each aspect is an immutable sha lock (`ADR-GLOBS:9`), marker `<unit>-<aspect>.yml`. A shipped unit is therefore **1 + 1 = 2 immutable,
versioned artifacts** — one `live`, one `tests` — stored and versioned independently: a `tests`-only change never re-keys `live`, and a
runtime change never re-keys `tests`. A unit's rolled-up identity is the _set_ of its aspect locks, not a separate whole-unit marker (that
marker is dropped — its sha would re-key on any change, defeating the isolation). Single-file units (internal `.psm1` modules) have no
`tests/`, so they carry the degenerate one-artifact partition.

### Rule ADR-ASPECT:5

The partition invariant — disjoint + exhaustive over `git ls-files` — is an integrity gate: a file claimed by two aspects, or by none, fails
it (`AspectPartition.Validate`). The `module-leftovers` catch-all (`ADR-PROTGLOB`) is the module-space complement — files under `automation/`
that no module partition claims — and stays empty in a clean tree.

## Context

A module is not one fileset — it holds two kinds of thing with opposite roles: the runtime code that ships to production, and the tests that
verify it. Collapsing them into one sha-marker means a test-only edit re-keys the module's identity, firing everything downstream that keys
on "did this module change" — even though nothing shippable moved. Isolation demands they be separate, versioned areas-of-control.

## Decision

Aspects make the split first-class and fail-safe. The `live` surface is a **closed, explicit** convention; everything it does not claim —
tests, docs, editor droppings, a file dropped at a module's root — falls through to the non-live `tests` remainder. Shipping is therefore
default-deny: a new file can only enter `live` by an explicit convention change, never by accident. The two aspects partition the module
exactly (ordered first-match with a `**` remainder guarantees it), and each is locked and versioned on its own.

The convention lives in the `aspects` variant so the vocabulary can evolve (a future `config`/`docs` aspect is one more ordered rule, `live`
still the closed head and the `**` remainder still non-live) without touching the engine. `Catzc.Base.Globs` reads it through `Get-Aspect`
and compiles per unit root with `AspectPartition`; `Get-ModuleGlobSet` derives `<module>-live` / `<module>-tests` and their markers.

## Consequences

- **Isolated identities.** A test edit and a runtime edit touch different markers; downstream (protection, blast-radius, triggers) sees the
  precise one.
- **Fail-safe shipping.** An unclassified file defaults to non-live — it cannot ride into production unnoticed.
- **One convention, many granularities.** The same ordered rule set that partitions a module is what a track's `-live`/`-tests` delivery
  packages use when derived — one convention, module and track alike.
- **Protection unchanged in meaning.** A module's protection identity folds both aspect hashes (`Get-ModuleProtectionIdentity`), reproducing
  the pre-aspect whole-module identity — the split refines the markers, not what a module's tests depend on.
